## Introduction
This project was the culminating project for ECE241 at UofT. We chose to program a simplified version of pacman in Verilog, with the program being run on the DE1-SoC FPGA board. An image of the game layout can be found below.

## Features
The game allows pacman to collect coins and move around our maze. The score is outputted onto the 7-seg HEX output of the FPGA board, and the movement is read from a PS2 keyboard. Debugging was done using ModelSim and we used Quartus Prime for development.
